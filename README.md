There's two basic ways you can install airflow:
1. locally (where you have to download all the functionalities individually)
2. using Docker (Docker containers provide an isolated environment for running Airflow and its dependencies)

**This will take you through the steps to install Airflow using Docker.**

 ```bash
    git clone https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
